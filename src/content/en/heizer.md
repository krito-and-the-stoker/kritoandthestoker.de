##### Graphics design & art historian
This is the stoker. He works hard to heat the chip with 2D and 3D **graphics**. With plenty of love for detail he creates new **worlds**. Without him our games would be boring tables. He knows the grafics engine pretty well and paints even in the old machines beautiful images.

As a studied *art historian and historian** he has a special view for historic presentation and interrelation.
