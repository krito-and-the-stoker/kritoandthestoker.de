# Who we are
We are *Krito* and *Stoker*. A **mathematician/developer** and a **art historian/grafics designer**. We are all that you need to develop fantastic video games. We admire smart strategy games. Our video games have valuable content and systematic and encourage to dive in.

We lead the player into exciting historic worlds. We are not interested in labarous click work motivated by the next achivement but in a playful interaction with historic systems. The main ambition is to combine complexity with an intuitive approach to a atmospheric world.
