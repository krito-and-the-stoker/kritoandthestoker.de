# Who we are

We are *Krito* and *Heizer* â€” a **developer/mathematician** and a **graphic artist/art historian**.

Our passion lies in smart historical strategy games. We create single-player games that are systematic, engaging, and designed for players to immerse themselves in for hours on end.

We bring players into fascinating historical worlds and systems. Our core ambition is to combine complexity with intuitive accessibility and a rich, atmospheric experience.
