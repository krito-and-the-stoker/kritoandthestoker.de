##### Coder & musician
This is Krito. He programs the board computer and takes care that our project don't hit any rocks. He has studied **mathematics** and is a
seasoned *programmer*. Thanks to his foresight we port around every obstacle.

And when he is not busy programming, he just goes into his **sound studio** and records *music* and *sounds*, so that our game worlds also sound fantastic.
