We care strongly about this game and at the same time it is somewhat ambitioned. We started it in early 2018 with the goal to create a remake of the legendary *Colonization* of 1994.

We are fascinated by the scenario of colonizing America. The central themes of development and exploitation of the "New World", building a new society out of migration an the conflicts between European settlers and native Americans seems very exciting and up-to-date.
