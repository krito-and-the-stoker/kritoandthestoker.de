We started this as a hobby project in 2018 with the goal of developing a remake of the outstanding *Colonization* from 1994. However, we quickly realized that simply copying it would not be satisfying.

We are fascinated by the core scenario of America's colonization. The central themes of settling a supposedly "new" world, building societies through migration, as well as the conflicts between European settlers and the indigenous population, are highly compelling—and unfortunately still relevant today. Based on these thematic foundations (and some strategic elements from *Colonization* 1994), we are developing an independent grand strategy game with strong city-building elements, combining a traditional aesthetic with modern technology.

We are currently preparing our application for prototype funding from the Film and Media Foundation NRW, alongside a complementary crowdfunding campaign. This campaign aims to both strengthen the financial foundation for prototype development and establish an engaged community early on, with whom we can discuss progress and development decisions.

For our prototype, we plan to move away from the *Javascript* world entirely and fully embrace the *Unreal Engine*, allowing us to present a more vibrant and detailed world.
